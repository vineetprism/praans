                taxation process by consolidating multiple indirect taxes into a single, unified tax framework.
                For businesses operating in India, GST registration is not just a legal requirement but also a
                critical step toward ensuring compliance and fostering seamless operations.

              What is GST Registration?

                GST registration is the procedure through which businesses and individuals obtain a unique
                Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN), granted to entities that are required
                to collect and remit GST. This registration ensures that businesses are recognized under the
                GST law and can legally operate under the framework.
              </p>
              <p>
                Businesses exceeding a certain turnover threshold or operating in specific sectors must
                register for GST to stay compliant. Once registered, the business can collect GST from
                customers, claim input tax credit on purchases, and file GST returns.
